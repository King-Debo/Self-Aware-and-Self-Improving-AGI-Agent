# AGI Agent Project

This project aims to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) agent that can learn and perform various tasks across different domains, such as Atari games, robotics, and natural language processing. The project uses the OpenCog framework and the OpenAI Gym framework to design and implement the AGI agent.

## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries and frameworks:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCog
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- SpaCy
- Gensim
- Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

## Usage

The project consists of four main files:

- metamodel.py: This file defines the metamodel and the framework for the AGI agent, following the guidelines of the OpenCog framework. The metamodel consists of several components, such as the knowledge representation, the cognitive functions, the learning mechanisms, and the goals and values of the AGI agent.
- architecture.py: This file defines the modular and hierarchical architecture for the AGI agent, following the guidelines of the OpenCog framework. The architecture consists of several modules, such as the perception module, the memory module, the reasoning module, the planning module, the action module, and the communication module. Each module implements the corresponding cognitive function and provides the necessary interfaces and functions for the AGI agent. The modules are connected by the AtomSpace, which is a hypergraph-based knowledge representation that allows for efficient and flexible manipulation of heterogeneous data and information.
- optimization.py: This file defines the multi-objective optimization approach for the AGI agent, following the guidelines of the NSGA-III algorithm. The approach consists of three steps: the initialization step, the evolution step, and the selection step. The initialization step generates a population of candidate solutions, which are the parameters, policies, and architectures of the AGI agent. The evolution step applies various operators, such as crossover, mutation, and adaptation, to the candidate solutions to generate new solutions. The selection step uses a reference-point-based selection mechanism to select the best solutions according to multiple objectives, such as reward, complexity, diversity, and regret.
- environments.py: This file defines the environments and tasks for the AGI agent, following the guidelines of the OpenAI Gym framework. The environments and tasks are diverse and challenging, such as Atari games, robotics, and natural language processing. The environments and tasks provide the necessary interfaces and functions for the AGI agent, such as the observation space, the action space, the reward function, and the termination condition.
- main.py: This file defines the main function that runs the AGI agent in the environments and tasks, using the metamodel, the architecture, and the optimization approach. The main function creates an object of the Metamodel class, an object of the Architecture class, an object of the Optimization class, and an object of the Environments class. The main function calls the optimize method of the Optimization class to get the optimal solutions for the AGI agent. The main function then runs the AGI agent in the environments and tasks, using the optimal solutions, and collects the performance, complexity, diversity, and regret metrics. The main function also renders the current state of the environments and tasks, and displays the metrics of the AGI agent.

To run the project, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
